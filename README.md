### Full description

> Build a simple drawing app that allows the user to create simple bezier objects in an editing window. The user can pick a simple preset shape (circle, square, rounded rectangle, star, etc), assign dimensions and a unique name when the bezier path is created.
>
> Once a bezier shape has been created, the user can edit the shape pathâ€™s anchors and handles to modify the paths. The user should also be able to select and translate the entire shape path (when not clicking on an anchor or handle).
>
> Paths that show up in the editing window should also show in a list view which displays the path name and path visibility. The user can toggle visibility of each path individually from the list view.

> - Architecture and code quality are key
> - Cocoa with no third-party libraries
> - Swift or Objective-C
> - No need to support scrolling or zooming in the drawing view
> - UI design is up to you
> - Should not take more than 2 days of work; Please track your time
> - macOS preferred but can be done in iOS for iPad (if you are open to learning macOS later)
